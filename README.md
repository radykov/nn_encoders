# Simple linear encoding works for MNIST. 
A few encoding neurons can be used to decode a number like 9, where as the number 6 requires more.
15 neurons creates recognizeable images and 50 does a reasonable job. 
Feel free to play around changing the amount of encoding neurons for yourself.

I did 2 implementations for MNIST, one in keras one in TensorFow

# CIFAR-10 Linear & MLP
Doesn't really work well at generalising 

# CIFAR-10 Convoluted
